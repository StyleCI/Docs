# Slack

StyleCI supports sending notifications to Slack! We send notifications for enabling & disabling of repos as well passing & failing analyses. Slack notifications are configured across your entire account and can be enabled by visiting your account page.

Simply click the "Enable Slack" button, and enter the webhook address, and you're done! You can generate a webhook for yourself by adding an "Incoming WebHook" as a "Custom Integration".

> {info} Slack notifications are only available on the Startup plan or higher.
