# Badges

You can find copy and paste badge code on any analysis page for each repo. Click on the badge, and you'll be presented with the code. Alternatively, you can add `/shield` to the URL of the main page of your repo on StyleCI to get the badge URL.

By default, we use the "flat-square" style, but you can also choose from "flat", or "plastic" by appending `?style=flat` to `?style=square` to the badge URL. We also support setting the branch you want by appending `?branch=your-branch` to the URL.

Here is an example badge URL for the Laravel Framework:

__Normal__

`https://github.styleci.io/repos/7548986/shield`

![StyleCI](https://github.styleci.io/repos/7548986/shield)

__Plastic__

`https://github.styleci.io/repos/7548986/shield?style=plastic`

![StyleCI](https://github.styleci.io/repos/7548986/shield?style=plastic)

__Flat for Branch 5.1__

`https://github.styleci.io/repos/7548986/shield?style=plastic&branch=5.1`
