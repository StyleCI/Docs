# Badges

You can copy and paste the badge code from any analysis page. Click on the badge and you'll be presented with options for the Raw Image, Markdown and HTML code. You can also add `/shield` to the URL of the main page of your repo on StyleCI to get the badge URL.

By default, we use the "flat-square" style, but you can also choose from "flat", or "plastic" by appending `?style=flat` to `?style=square` to the badge URL. We also support setting the branch you want by appending `?branch=your-branch` to the URL.

Here is an example badge URL for the Laravel Framework:

__Normal__

`https://github.styleci.io/repos/7548986/shield`

![StyleCI](https://github.styleci.io/repos/7548986/shield)

__Plastic__

`https://github.styleci.io/repos/7548986/shield?style=plastic`

![StyleCI](https://github.styleci.io/repos/7548986/shield?style=plastic)

__Flat for Branch 6.x__

`https://github.styleci.io/repos/7548986/shield?style=flat&branch=6.x`
