## I can't access my team's private repos

By default, StyleCI only requests public repo scopes from GitHub. If you are getting error 403 errors, or your team's private repos are not showing up, then it is likely that you need to enable private repo access. This is free to do, and can be done from the home page, when logged in, or from the [profile page](https://github.styleci.io/profile).

## What do I do with my business's VAT ID

If you are using StyleCI on behalf of VAT registered business within the EU, Switzerland or Norway, please provide us with your VAT ID. This can be done via the StyleCI account page(s).

<a name="not-receiving-email-notifications"></a>
## Why am I not receiving notification emails

If you're not receiving any of our notification emails, it could be down to one of several issues.

### Whitelist us

A good starting point is to ensure that the email address we use to send emails to you isn't blacklisted or marked as spam by your email provider. We may send mail from the following email addesses:

* Customer service and support emails are sent from support@styleci.io;
* Transactional and notification emails are sent from notify@styleci.io;
* Emails from our payment provider, Stripe, are sent from billing@styleci.io, card-expiring@styleci.io, and failed-payment@styleci.io.

### Check your email address

We send emails to email address that you set as your primary email on GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket. You can check the email address that we have for you by visiting your profile page at [StyleCI for GitHub](https://github.styleci.io/profile), [StyleCI for GitLab](https://gitlab.styleci.io/profile), or [StyleCI for Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.styleci.io/profile). You can also configure your notification preferences from this page.

## Do you keep a change log?

Yes, we document all major changes we make on our [blog](https://blog.styleci.io/). A recent important change is that since 23rd December 2019, we parse files as PHP 7.4, rather than 7.3 (previously 7.1 until June 2019). Our blog post about that change is available [here](https://blog.styleci.io/php-7-4-support/) (respectively [here](https://blog.styleci.io/php-7-3-support/)).
